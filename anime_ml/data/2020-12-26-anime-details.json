Tem's friend Legoshi, a grey wolf in the stage crew, has been an object of fear and suspicion for his whole life. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, he continues to lay low and hide his menacing traits, much to the disapproval of Louis, a red deer and the domineering star actor of the drama club.\n\nWhen Louis sneaks into the auditorium to train Tem's replacement for an upcoming play, he assigns Legoshi to lookout duty. That very night, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a white dwarf rabbit scorned by her peers. His growing feelings for Haru, complicated by his predatory instincts, force him to confront his own true nature, the circumstances surrounding the death of his friend, and the undercurrent of violence plaguing the world around him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.08, "rank": 429, "popularity": 311, "num_list_users": 392051, "num_scoring_users": 229029, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2019-02-04T08:28:06+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T20:23:36+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "plan_to_watch", "score": 0, "num_episodes_watched": 0, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2020-09-20T23:35:03+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2019, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "thursday", "start_time": "00:55"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1377, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1758/98917.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1758/98917l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/99969.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/99969l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1234/102008.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1234/102008l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 40935, "title": "Beastars 2nd Season", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "sequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Sequel"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 40060, "title": "BNA", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/106986.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1139/106986l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 11}, {"node": {"id": 35557, "title": "Houseki no Kuni (TV)", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/88293.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/88293l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 38668, "title": "Dorohedoro", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1740/104786.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1740/104786l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 1961, "title": "Arashi no Yoru ni", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 23847, "title": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.

But somewhere in the academy, a menacing creature hides, waiting for its opportune moment to strike.\n\nBoogiepop wa Warawanai subtly explores the intrinsic associations between human beings and their perception of time, while delving into its characters' complex relationships, emotions, memories, and pasts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.11, "rank": 3131, "popularity": 889, "num_list_users": 158184, "num_scoring_users": 42490, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2018-03-10T03:16:22+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T19:05:48+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 14, "name": "Horror"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "dropped", "score": 6, "num_episodes_watched": 13, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-06-01T23:44:24+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 18, "start_season": {"year": 2019, "season": "winter"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "friday", "start_time": "21:00"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1420, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1136/90971.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1136/90971l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1135/95454.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1135/95454l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 369, "title": "Boogiepop wa Warawanai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/95777.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/95777l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "other", "relation_type_formatted": "Other"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 2593, "title": "Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21741.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21741l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 6}, {"node": {"id": 6746, "title": "Durarara!!", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 339, "title": "Serial Experiments Lain", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1718/91550.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1718/91550l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 2251, "title": "Baccano!", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/14547l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 1, "title": "Cowboy Bebop", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/19644.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/19644l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 9253, "title": "Steins;Gate", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73199.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/73199l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 34102, "title": "Sakurada Reset", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 28621, "title": "Subete ga F ni Naru", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76071.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/76071l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 1022, "title": "Generator Gawl", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/19006.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/19006l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 36548, "title": "Kokkoku", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89987l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}], "studios": [{"id": 11, "name": "Madhouse"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "20131", "completed": "45651", "on_hold": "10893", "dropped": "19921", "plan_to_watch": "62101"}, "num_list_users": 158697}}

Without warning she exclaims \"Anpan!\" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Nagisa Furukawa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the encounter off as nothing.\n\nHowever, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school. Eventually he concedes and befriends her. Tomoya learns Nagisa has been held back a year due to a severe illness and that her dream is to revive the school's drama club. Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.\n\nAs Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems.

There he meets Rui, a girl whose lack of excitement rivals that of himself. After bonding over their mutual awkwardness, Rui takes Natsuo to her house and asks him to have sex with her, hoping that the experience will stop her friends from treating her like a clueless child. With his hopeless feelings towards Hina still on his mind, Natsuo hesitantly agrees.\n\nEqually unfulfilled by their \"first times,\" the two decide to part ways as strangers.

However, he will soon learn that the truth comes at a far greater price than he could have ever imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.53, "rank": 1482, "popularity": 70, "num_list_users": 919588, "num_scoring_users": 473726, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2011-06-08T21:16:25+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T16:03:12+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Mecha"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 7, "num_episodes_watched": 22, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2018-01-04T13:22:19+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 22, "start_season": {"year": 2011, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "friday", "start_time": "01:15"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/30863.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/30863l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32233.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32233l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32237.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32237l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/33713.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/33713l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/41705.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/41705l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/44241.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/44241l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/73136.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/73136l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/93983.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/93983l.jpg"}], "background": "The first two episodes of Guilty Crown were screened at the New York Anime Festival on October 15, 2011.

As if things couldn't get any worse, she loses control and unleashes an explosion if her powers remain unused. Faced with no other choice, Nitta finds himself becoming her caregiver. \n\nTo let her use her powers freely, Nitta asks Hina to help out with a construction deal, which goes smoothly. But while this is happening, a rival yakuza group covertly attacks his boss. To Nitta's shock, his colleagues later pin the blame on him! Tasked with attacking the rival group in retaliation, Nitta steels himself and arrives at their hideout. But suddenly, Hina unexpectedly steps in and helps him wipe out the entire group. As it turns out, Hina might just become a valuable asset to Nitta and his yakuza business, provided she does not use her powers on him first!

What is Hitomi's purpose there, and why do Yuito's drawings return such breathtaking color to her drab world?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.57, "rank": 1362, "popularity": 647, "num_list_users": 214044, "num_scoring_users": 80071, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2018-03-16T11:02:58+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T14:49:17+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 16, "name": "Magic"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "dropped", "score": 0, "num_episodes_watched": 6, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-03-24T00:22:55+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2018, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "01:55"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1453, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1618/91118.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1618/91118l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1424/93855.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1424/93855l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/93902.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/93902l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1445/95324.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1445/95324l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 33352, "title": "Violet Evergarden", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1795/95088.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1795/95088l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 13}, {"node": {"id": 16067, "title": "Nagi no Asu kara", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/53549.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/53549l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 35062, "title": "Mahoutsukai no Yome", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/88476.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/88476l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 31376, "title": "Flying Witch", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80039.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80039l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 32281, "title": "Kimi no Na wa.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87048.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87048l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 30015, "title": "ReLIFE", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/82149.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/82149l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 36470, "title": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 28851, "title": "Koe no Katachi", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1122/96435.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1122/96435l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 9989, "title": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79697.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79697l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 27775, "title": "Plastic Memories", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/72750.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/72750l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}], "studios": [{"id": 132, "name": "P.A.

Meanwhile, second-year student Ena Komiya seeks to revive the photography club to its former glory, refusing to let the organization be disbanded. Though this group lacks a strong connection with one another, their lives suddenly cross paths with the arrival of a third-year transfer student.\n\nWhile a transfer so close to graduation is unusual for most, it is business as usual for Eita Izumi. Due to his father's work, he has never been able to stay in one place for very long.

Being in a dilemma about which club to join, Yui Hirasawa stumbles upon and applies for the Light Music Club, which she misinterprets to be about playing simple instruments, such as castanets. Unable to play an instrument, she decides to visit to apologize and quit.\n\nMeanwhile, the Light Music Club faces disbandment due to a lack of members. This causes the club members to offer anything, from food to slacking off during club time, in order to convince Yui to join. Despite their efforts, Yui insists on leaving due to her lack of musical experience. As a last resort, they play a piece for Yui, which sparks her fiery passion and finally convinces her to join the club.\n\nFrom then onward, it's just plain messing around with bits and pieces of practice.

Since many of the students are the children of the richest people in the world, the academy has its quirks that separate it from all the others. By day, it is a normal school, educating its pupils in history, languages, and the like. But at night, it turns into a gambling den, educating them in the art of dealing with money and manipulating people. Money is power; those who come out on top in the games stand at the top of the school.\n\nYumeko Jabami, a seemingly naive and beautiful transfer student, is ready to try her hand at Hyakkaou's special curriculum. Unlike the rest, she doesn't play to win, but for the thrill of the gamble, and her borderline insane way of gambling might just bring too many new cards to the table.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.45, "rank": 1728, "popularity": 103, "num_list_users": 751388, "num_scoring_users": 429786, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2017-02-17T03:37:24+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T20:09:24+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 11, "name": "Game"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 7, "num_episodes_watched": 12, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-06-18T12:31:50+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2017, "season": "summer"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "22:00"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1470, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/86577.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/86577l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/86578.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/86578l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/97081.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/97081l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 37086, "title": "Kakegurui\u00d7\u00d7", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1496/96519.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1496/96519l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "sequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Sequel"}, {"node": {"id": 38939, "title": "Kakegurui Picture Drama", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1914/98035.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1914/98035l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "side_story", "relation_type_formatted": "Side story"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 19815, "title": "No Game No Life", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/65187.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/65187l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 28}, {"node": {"id": 3002, "title": "Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80032.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/80032l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 19}, {"node": {"id": 35507, "title": "Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e (TV)", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/86829.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/86829l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 13}, {"node": {"id": 28223, "title": "Death Parade", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/71553.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/71553l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 12}, {"node": {"id": 28171, "title": "Shokugeki no Souma", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/72943.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/72943l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 11}, {"node": {"id": 5040, "title": "One Outs", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/22669.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/22669l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 6}, {"node": {"id": 16592, "title": "Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/51463.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/51463l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 36525, "title": "Dorei-ku The Animation", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1801/90264.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1801/90264l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 4}, {"node": {"id": 550, "title": "Yu\u2606Gi\u2606Oh!", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/47487.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/47487l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 658, "title": "Touhai Densetsu Akagi: Yami ni Maiorita Tensai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/53587.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/53587l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}], "studios": [{"id": 569, "name": "MAPPA"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "50984", "completed": "549450", "on_hold": "17490", "dropped": "29218", "plan_to_watch": "110026"}, "num_list_users": 757168}}

Shackled to Elsie via a deadly collar, Keima now has his title of \"God of Conquest\" put to the ultimate test as he is forced to navigate through the hearts of a multitude of real-life girls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.75, "rank": 918, "popularity": 220, "num_list_users": 494407, "num_scoring_users": 266467, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2010-04-02T08:58:20+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T06:33:20+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Harem"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}, {"id": 37, "name": "Supernatural"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 7, "num_episodes_watched": 12, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-06-12T22:16:07+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2010, "season": "fall"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "thursday", "start_time": "01:50"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1414, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/27130.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/27130l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/27134.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/27134l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40481.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40481l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/43361.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/43361l.jpg"}], "background": "There was a limited viewing on September 25, 2010.

Moreover, once Diana and her sisters are reunited, their power can seal the runaway spirits away for good and relieve Keima of his exorcising duties.

She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.\n\nAs the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day.

With their fates literally intertwined, the Kiznaivers must expose their true selves to each other, or risk failing much more than just the Kizuna System.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.45, "rank": 1731, "popularity": 209, "num_list_users": 511915, "num_scoring_users": 247494, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2015-10-08T08:23:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T19:30:49+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Romance"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 6, "num_episodes_watched": 12, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-01-03T20:13:21+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2016, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "saturday", "start_time": "23:30"}, "source": "original", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/76887.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/76887l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/78466.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/78466l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79426.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79426l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/80897.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/80897l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/80898.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/80898l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 39884, "title": "Hajimari no Sokudo", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1021/101152.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1021/101152l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "other", "relation_type_formatted": "Other"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 11887, "title": "Kokoro Connect", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/39665.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/39665l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 28}, {"node": {"id": 35849, "title": "Darling in the FranXX", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1614/90408.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1614/90408l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 10}, {"node": {"id": 9989, "title": "Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79697.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79697l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 10}, {"node": {"id": 21603, "title": "Mekakucity Actors", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/61519.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/61519l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 8}, {"node": {"id": 23283, "title": "Zankyou no Terror", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/64447.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/64447l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 7}, {"node": {"id": 30015, "title": "ReLIFE", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/82149.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/82149l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 4}, {"node": {"id": 37426, "title": "Sarazanmai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1159/100455.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1159/100455l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 11433, "title": "Ano Natsu de Matteru", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/59405.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/59405l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 35507, "title": "Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e (TV)", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/86829.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/86829l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 23273, "title": "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/67177.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/67177l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}], "studios": [{"id": 803, "name": "Trigger"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "34273", "completed": "314662", "on_hold": "15676", "dropped": "21906", "plan_to_watch": "127129"}, "num_list_users": 513646}}

Sadly for Jouro, both girls proclaim their love for his best friend Taiyou \"Sun-chan\" Ooga, the ace of the baseball team.

A schemer under his cheery facade, he makes the best of this unexpected turn of events with a new plan: get Sun-chan to fall for either Cosmos or Himawari and take the other as his own prize. But Jouro's last-ditch effort is threatened by the gloomy, four-eyed Sumireko \"Pansy\" Sanshokuin, who surprises Jouro with not only her knowledge of his secret personality but also a confession to

With loads of absurdity and sexual humor that keeps on coming, Takatoshi needs to harden up if he is going to keep up with all the madness around him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.75, "rank": 925, "popularity": 718, "num_list_users": 193580, "num_scoring_users": 95475, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2013-10-12T10:26:35+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T17:16:42+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 8, "num_episodes_watched": 13, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-01-03T20:16:45+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 13, "start_season": {"year": 2014, "season": "winter"}, "source": "4_koma_manga", "average_episode_duration": 1420, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/56941.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/56941l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79015.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79015l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 10119, "title": "Seitokai Yakuindomo OVA", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/41873.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/41873l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}, {"node": {"id": 26123, "title": "Seitokai Yakuindomo* OVA", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/79008l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "sequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Sequel"}, {"node": {"id": 34504, "title": "Seitokai Yakuindomo Movie", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/87184.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/87184l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "parent_story", "relation_type_formatted": "Parent story"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 7791, "title": "K-On!!", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76121.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/76121l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 18495, "title": "Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/59639.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/59639l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 14511, "title": "Minami-ke Tadaima", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/53133.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/53133l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 32013, "title": "Oshiete!

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.46, "rank": 120, "popularity": 2, "num_list_users": 2316411, "num_scoring_users": 1588974, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2012-12-05T12:03:21+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T20:37:25+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 8, "num_episodes_watched": 25, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-06-13T18:41:31+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 25, "start_season": {"year": 2013, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "sunday", "start_time": "01:58"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44560.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44560l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/55237.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/55237l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56785.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56785l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56787.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56787l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/60591.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/60591l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/60593.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/60593l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63799.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63799l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/104606.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/104606l.jpg"}], "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin adapts content from the first 8 volumes of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.\n\nThe last episode received a pre-airing in Tokyo, Marunouchi Piccadilly 1 theater on Saturday, September 28, 2013.

Efforts to eradicate these monsters continue; however, threats arise not only from the Titans beyond the walls, but from the humans within them as well.\n\nAfter being rescued from the Colossal and Armored Titans, Eren Yaeger devotes himself to improving his Titan form. Krista Lenz struggles to accept the loss of her friend, Captain Levi chooses Eren and his friends to form his new personal squad, and Commander Erwin Smith recovers from his injuries. All seems well for the soldiers, until the government suddenly demands custody of Eren and Krista. The Survey Corps' recent successes have drawn attention, and a familiar face from Levi's past is sent to collect the wanted soldiers. Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Krista safe.\n\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, Eren and his fellow soldiers are not only fighting for their survival against the terrifying Titans, but also against the terror of a far more conniving foe: humans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.56, "rank": 80, "popularity": 58, "num_list_users": 1029923, "num_scoring_users": 621506, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2017-06-17T14:15:58+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T20:00:22+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Super Power"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 8, "num_episodes_watched": 12, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-01-03T20:17:41+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2018, "season": "summer"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "monday", "start_time": "00:35"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1434, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/86318.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/86318l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/88716.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/88716l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/90036.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/90036l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1627/92098.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1627/92098l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1173/92110.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1173/92110l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1873/99448.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1873/99448l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1775/99449.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1775/99449l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1349/99450.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1349/99450l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1532/99451.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1532/99451l.jpg"}], "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin adapts content from volumes 13-17 of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 25777, "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/84177.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/84177l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}, {"node": {"id": 38524, "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1517/100633.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1517/100633l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "sequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Sequel"}, {"node": {"id": 39477, "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Specials", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/99638.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1909/99638l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "side_story", "relation_type_formatted": "Side story"}, {"node": {"id": 42091, "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin: Chronicle", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1786/110717.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1786/110717l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "summary", "relation_type_formatted": "Summary"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 13125, "title": "Shinsekai yori", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/36775.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/36775l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 1889, "title": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/14114.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/14114l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}], "studios": [{"id": 858, "name": "Wit Studio"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "59670", "completed": "825263", "on_hold": "10194", "dropped": "5854", "plan_to_watch": "139297"}, "num_list_users": 1040278}}

Regardless of her decision, the path she chooses is one that will affect the past, the present, and the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.5, "rank": 103, "popularity": 275, "num_list_users": 432750, "num_scoring_users": 255325, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2011-09-13T17:43:03+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T15:27:11+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 7, "num_episodes_watched": 1, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-06-13T18:17:56+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2013, "season": "spring"}, "source": "visual_novel", "average_episode_duration": 5400, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46591.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46591l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/46633.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/46633l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50317.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50317l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50319.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50319l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56947.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56947l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/57281.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/57281l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/57283.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/57283l.jpg"}], "background": "The series won the 2013 Newtype Anime Awards for Best Anime Film.", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 10863, "title": "Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36531.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/36531l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "prequel", "relation_type_formatted": "Prequel"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 7311, "title": "Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/73842.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/73842l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 14}, {"node": {"id": 32281, "title": "Kimi no Na wa.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87048.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87048l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 7}, {"node": {"id": 38329, "title": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1613/102179.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1613/102179l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}, {"node": {"id": 15335, "title": "Gintama Movie 2: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/51723.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/51723l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 1087, "title": "Kimagure Orange\u2606Road", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/41339.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/41339l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 2}, {"node": {"id": 433, "title": "Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/433.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/433l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}, {"node": {"id": 4282, "title": "Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/9246.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/9246l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 1}], "studios": [{"id": 314, "name": "White Fox"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "6792", "completed": "328573", "on_hold": "2485", "dropped": "979", "plan_to_watch": "94050"}, "num_list_users": 432879}}

The story is based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.88, "rank": 688, "popularity": 110, "num_list_users": 726409, "num_scoring_users": 385763, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2006-04-07T17:07:21+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T17:36:38+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 6, "num_episodes_watched": 14, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2019-02-25T12:16:35+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 14, "start_season": {"year": 2006, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "monday", "start_time": "00:00"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1420, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/13491.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/13491l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/13649.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/13649l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/13925.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/13925l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/63693.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/63693l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/65791.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/65791l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73138.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73138l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75901.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75901l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89073.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/89073l.jpg"}], "background": "The episodes for this series were intentionally not broadcast in chronological order.

He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.\n\nIn order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life.

Melromarc is a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly ravaged the land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are respectively bestowed a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the \"Shield Hero.\" Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality.\n\nWhen the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against and hated by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of hurt and mistrust in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being on his own sets in, so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.\n\nAs the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight for the survival of the kingdom and protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.01, "rank": 527,

However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.\n\nWhen Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm.

The students enjoy an unparalleled amount of freedom, and it is ranked highly in Japan. However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment.\n\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible.\n\nWhile class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 7.86, "rank": 713, "popularity": 203, "num_list_users": 523696, "num_scoring_users": 312391, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2017-05-01T06:27:59+00:00", "updated_at": "2020-12-26T20:17:54+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 36, "name": "Slice of Life"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Psychological"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 23, "name": "School"}], "my_list_status": {"status": "completed", "score": 8, "num_episodes_watched": 12, "is_rewatching": false, "updated_at": "2020-09-23T20:51:49+00:00"}, "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2017, "season": "summer"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "wednesday", "start_time": "23:30"}, "source": "light_novel", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/86829.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/86829l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86830.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/86830l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/87022.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/87022l.jpg"}], "background": "", "related_anime": [{"node": {"id": 30813, "title": "Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/74160.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/74160l.jpg"}}, "relation_type": "other", "relation_type_formatted": "Other"}], "recommendations": [{"node": {"id": 14813, "title": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/49459.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/49459l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 41}, {"node": {"id": 24833, "title": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 21}, {"node": {"id": 34933, "title": "Kakegurui", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/86578.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/86578l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 13}, {"node": {"id": 6347, "title": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50389.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50389l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 13}, {"node": {"id": 20785, "title": "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/61039.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/61039l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 8}, {"node": {"id": 12189, "title": "Hyouka", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/50521.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/50521l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 7}, {"node": {"id": 17729, "title": "Grisaia no Kajitsu", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73591.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73591l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 5}, {"node": {"id": 16592, "title": "Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/51463.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/51463l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 4}, {"node": {"id": 37450, "title": "Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/93586.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/93586l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 4}, {"node": {"id": 19815, "title": "No Game No Life", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/65187.jpg", "large": "https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/65187l.jpg"}}, "num_recommendations": 3}], "studios": [{"id": 456, "name": "Lerche"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "28040", "completed": "397390", "on_hold": "6973", "dropped": "9330", "plan_to_watch": "85412"}, "num_list_users": 527145}}

From pitching her tent to gathering firewood, she has always done everything by herself, and has no plans of leaving her little solitary world.\n\nHowever, what starts off as one of Rin's usual camping sessions somehow ends up as a surprise get-together for two when the lost Nadeshiko Kagamihara is forced to take refuge at her campsite. Originally intending to see the picturesque view of Mount Fuji for herself, Nadeshiko's plans are disrupted when she ends up falling asleep partway to her destination. Alone and with no other choice, she seeks help from the only other person nearby. Despite their hasty introductions, the two girls nevertheless enjoy the chilly night together, eating ramen and conversing while the campfire keeps them warm. And even after Nadeshiko's sister finally picks her up later that night, both girls silently ponder the possibility of another camping trip together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.27,
